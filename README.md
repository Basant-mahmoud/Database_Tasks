# Database Tasks Repository

This repository contains a collection of **database practice tasks** implemented using SQL Server. The tasks cover a wide range of database concepts, queries, and operations that are commonly used in real-world applications.

## Contents

The repository includes practices and examples for:

* **Stored Procedures**: Creating and executing stored procedures to encapsulate SQL logic.
* **Triggers**: Implementing triggers to enforce business rules and automate actions.
* **Functions**: Writing user-defined functions (scalar and table-valued) for reusable logic.
* **Views**: Creating views to simplify complex queries and improve data security.
* **Joins**: Using INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN to combine data from multiple tables.
* **SELECT Queries**: Writing DQL (Data Query Language) queries to retrieve data.
* **SELECT INTO / INSERT INTO**: Copying data into new tables or inserting into existing ones.
* **DML Queries**: Data Manipulation Language operations including `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
* **DQL**: Data Query Language commands like `SELECT`.
* **Transactions**: Using `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` for data consistency.
* **Constraints & Keys**: Working with Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, Unique, Check, and Default constraints.
* **Indexes**: Creating and managing clustered and non-clustered indexes to optimize performance.
* **User Logging**: Examples of logging and auditing database user actions.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a **hands-on practice collection** for learning and mastering database concepts. It is especially useful for anyone preparing for technical interviews, practicing SQL, or building a stronger foundation in relational databases.

## Tools & Technologies

* **SQL Server** (main database engine)
* T-SQL (Transact-SQL)
* Database design and query optimization techniques
